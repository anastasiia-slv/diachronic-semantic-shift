The following repository supplements the study 'Is Change the Only Constant? An Inquiry Into Diachronic Semantic Shifts in Romance Languages' by Matteo Melis and Anastasiia Salova. The primary focus of this study is to investigate the presence of statistical laws governing semantic shifts within the Romance language group, specifically Italian and Spanish. To view the entire paper, please open the .pdf file provided in the repository.

In order to run the code:
1. Create an environment and install the necessary packages. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Download the repository while preserving the internal structure.
3. Download the trained models and move them to the /Models folder, keep the same name.
The models can be dowloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7977342).
4. Run the main.py file in your Python interpreter.
```
python3 main.py
```

The script is interactive and takes inputs from the console. You need to specify parameters and the desired type of output yourself, following the steps outlined in the study.
